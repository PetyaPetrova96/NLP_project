# Named Entity Recognition (NER) Comparative Analysis: BiLSTM vs. BERT

## Introduction

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), involving the extraction and classification of named entities from text. However, NER presents challenges due to language ambiguity, inconsistencies in annotations, and the presence of unfamiliar words. In this project, we aim to compare the performance of two generations of deep learning models for NER, specifically focusing on their ability to generalize to unseen data domains.

## Goal

Our primary goal is to assess how two prominent deep learning models, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), perform in NER tasks across different text genres. We seek to investigate their generalizability by evaluating their performance on datasets representing diverse domains.

## Methodology

We employ three distinct datasets to conduct our comparative analysis. By leveraging these datasets, we aim to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each model, particularly in handling domain shifts and classifying named entities accurately. Our investigation focuses on analyzing the types of errors made by each model, identifying misclassified labels, and understanding the logic behind these errors.

## Main Findings

Our analysis reveals several key findings:

- BERT consistently outperforms BiLSTM across all datasets, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities.
- Both models exhibit challenges in accurately classifying certain named entity labels, particularly in ambiguous contexts.
- BiLSTM struggles more with domain shifts, often misclassifying entities and encountering difficulties with sentence structure comprehension.
- BERT's errors tend to have more logical explanations rooted in linguistic patterns, whereas BiLSTM errors lack clear patterns.
- Despite its advantages, BERT may occasionally misclassify named entities of the wrong type, albeit with higher overall accuracy compared to BiLSTM.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our study highlights the significant performance gap between BERT and BiLSTM in NER tasks, particularly concerning generalization to cross-domain data. BERT's robustness and superior performance underscore its suitability for a wide range of NLP applications, especially those involving diverse text genres. Future research could explore hybrid approaches or fine-tuning strategies to further enhance NER performance across different domains.
